## Revision of RV32I Instructions

In order to write assembly programs, we must get familiar with basic RV32I instructions.

## Common Pesudo-Instructions

- Basic pseudo-instructions (`li`, `mv`, `nop`)
- Control flow pseudo-instructions (`call`, `ret`, `beqz`)
- How assembler expands pseudo-instructions

To write RISC-V assembly code more conveniently, there are some of instructions have their own *alias*, or so called ***pseudo-instruction***.
Typically, for example, we would write `addi x1, x0, 0xFF` when we want to load a immediate into register *x1* with the value `0xFF`.
With the power of pesudo-instructions, however, we can simply write `li x1, 0xFF` to do the same thing.

For assembler, it will convert the pseudo-instructions into ***base instruction(s)*** before converting them into machine code.

The list below contains the common pseudo-instructions which might be useful when writing assembly programs.

| Pseudo-Instructions | Base Instruction(s) | Meaning |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------|
| ...                 | ...                 | ...     |

## Assembly Programming Basics

### Symbols and Labels

::: {.callout-tip}
For more information about symbols and labels, please refer to @symbol-gnu-as.
Furthermore, chapter 7 in the book @csapp-3e is also a good reference.
:::

According to @symbol-gnu-as:

> Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols to debug.

TBD

In the perspective of binary representation for instructions, the jump/branch target addresses are just memory addresses, while we can write ***labels*** in the assembly program with jump/branch instructions.
There are two type of labels, ***text label*** and ***numeric label***.

We often use text labels when writing if-else statement and loops. According to @riscv-asm-manual:

> Text labels are used as branch, unconditional jump targets and symbol offsets.
> Text labels are added to the symbol table of the compiled module.
>
> ```{.asm}
> loop:
>     j loop
> ```

The *symbol* `loop` above is exactly the text label we just mentioned. 

Besides, the other type of label is called ***numeric label***. According to @riscv-asm-manual as well:

> Numeric labels are used for local references.
> References to local labels are suffixed with 'f' for a forward reference or 'b' for a backwards reference.
> ```{.asm}
> 1:
>     j 1b
> ```

### Addressing for Wide Immediates and Addresses

### If-Else Statement

Before we go deep into how to implement if-else statement in assembly language, we must recall some basic logic operations for number comparison and ***De Morgan's Laws*** at first.

For number comparison within two numbers, we have the following properties:

$$
\neg (A > B) \equiv A \leq B
$$

$$
\neg (A < B) \equiv A \geq B
$$

$$
\neg (A \geq B) \equiv A < B
$$

$$
\neg (A \leq B) \equiv A > B
$$


$$
\neg (A == B) \equiv A \ne B
$$

$$
\neg (A \ne B) \equiv A == B
$$

Besides, according to De Morgan's Laws:

$$
\neg (A \wedge B) = \neg A \vee \neg B, \space and
$$

$$
\neg (A \vee B) = \neg A \wedge \neg B
$$

These useful logical properties might help us to write more concise and straightforward assembly codes if we can use them wisely.

Among RV32I instructions, there are **six** different conditional branch instructions we can use to implement the if-else statement in C language.
The main decision point to choose which branch instruction to use is that the condition(s) in if-else statements.

For example, consider the following if-else:

```{.cpp}
// suppose that a is stored in x1, and b is stored in x2
if (a > b) {
    // do job 1
} else {
    // do job 2
}
// exit
```

Intuitively, we would like to use *branch greater than* (bgt) instruction to implement this if-else statement.
In RV32I, howerver, there is no suck instruction called *bgt*. Instead, we should perform some transformation on the if-else statement by using basic logic operations.
For $a > b$, we know that $\neg (a > b) \equiv (a \leq b)$. Hence, we can rewrite the if-else statement in the following fashio.

```{.cpp}
if (a <= b) {
    // do job 2
} else {
    // do job 1
}
// exit
```

Finally, we can implement the transformated if-else statement by using *blt* or *bltu* instructions in RV32I, which depends on whether the number comparison is signed or unsigned.

```{.asm}
    blt x1, x2, job_2
job_1:
    ...
    j exit
job_2:
    ...
exit:
    ...
```

Let's consider a more complicated example with ***if-then-else*** statement.

### For-Loops

To implement for-loops, we can use a counter with conditional branch instructions.

## Fallacies and Pitfalls

1. ***Fallacy: More powerful instructions mean higher performance.***
2. ***Fallacy: Write in assembly language to obtain the highest performance.***
3. ***Pitfall: Forgetting that sequential word addresses in machines with byte addressing do not difer by one.***
4. ***Pitfall: Using a pointer to an automatic variable outside its defning procedure.***
