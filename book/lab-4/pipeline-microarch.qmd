Extend previous reference-model-based verification framework to adapt to pipeline CPU

- The problem about pipeline bubbles
- The pipeline bubble will lead to the synchronization issue between ISS (which can be viewed as a single-cycle CPU) and pipeline CPU
- We might have to add some check flags to notify the verification framework to stop ISS and wait for the completion of Pipeline CPU
- Hence, the main problem is how to extend the existed framework we have done in Lab 3 to address the 
  
要跟同學說 DiffTest 怎麼改才可以銜接到 Pipeline CPU 上面繼續使用（基本上就是講 ISS 如何 Skip Pipeline Bubbles 以達成 RTL-ISS Synchronization）
