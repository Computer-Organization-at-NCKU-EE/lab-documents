# Pipeline CPU Micro-Architecture Design

In Lab 4, our mission is to explore pipeline CPU micro-architecture and understand the synchronization issues that arise in simulation. To achieve this, we must investigate two key aspects:

The limitations and impractical aspects of a Single-Cycle CPU, including its Critical Timing Path

Additional issues to be determined (TBD) as we progress

By the end of this lab, you should be able to analyze why a single-cycle CPU design is inefficient in practice and recognize the challenges related to timing and synchronization. This will deepen your understanding of CPU micro-architecture, the pipeline design trade-offs, and real-world hardware constraints.
