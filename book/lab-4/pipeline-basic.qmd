# Fundamental and Motivation of Pipelining {#sec-pipeline-basics}

## The Motivation

### What is ***disadvantages*** of the single-cycle design?

- Critical Path is too long
- Low maximum clock rate
- Not compatible with non-ideal memory where the access latency is not zero
  
### How to shorten the critical path?

- The essence of pipeline design 
  (Try to calculate the time need to complete a LOAD instruction w/ single-cycle design and w/ pipeline design (demo example))
- The micro-architecture of a classic five stages pipeline CPU
