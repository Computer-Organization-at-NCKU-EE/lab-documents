# Building A Functional RISC-V ISA Simulator

In Lab 1, our mission is to build a ***functional simulator*** that can emulate a simple RISC-V machine.
To understand how to construct such a simulator, we must examine three key concepts:

- What a computer is
- What so called Software/Hardware Interface --- ISA is, and what RISC-V is
- How to use C language to build a simple RISC-V ***simulator***

By the end of this lab, you should be able to implement a simulator capable of decoding and executing most of the basic *RV32I* instructions.
In the process, you will also develop a solid understanding of fundamental computer concepts, as well as the RISC-V ISA.
