# Building A Functional RISC-V ISA Simulator

In Lab 1, our mission is to build a ***functional simulator*** that can emulate a simple RISC-V machine.
To understand how to construct such a simulator, we need to examine three key concepts:

- What is a computer?
- What is RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)?
- What is the internal structure of the simulator?

By the end of this lab, you should be able to implement a simulator capable of decoding and executing most of the basic *RV32I* instructions.
In the process, you will also develop a solid understanding of fundamental computer concepts as well as the RISC-V ISA.
