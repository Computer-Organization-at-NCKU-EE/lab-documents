# Lab 1 Assignment

## Steps To Prepare for Doing Lab 1 

::: {.callout-caution}
This part is only for students at NCKU.
:::

After accepting Lab 1 on the **GitHub Classroom**, you should have your own repository which contains the code template for lab 1.
Please clone the owned repository into your docker development environment under the path `/home/ubuntu/workspace`.

## After Completing Coding

After complete the implementation of the ISS, you can then compile it and run the unit tests.
To compile the ISS, please follow the commands below:

::: {.callout-caution}
It assumes that your code is placed inside the folder called `lab-1`.
:::

```{.shell}
$ cd lab-1
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```

After entering these commands, you should see something like:

![Build the ISS](images/build.png){width=75% fig-align="center"}

After building the code template TA provides, you can now run the unit tests by using the following command:

```{.shell}
$ ctest
```

![Run CTest](images/ctest.png){width=75% fig-aligh="center"}

Run the command below if you want to run a specific test case (e.g., runs ADD instruction only):

```{.shell}
$ ctest -R "add\$"
```

[As the minimal requirement]{.mark}, you should pass the **37** unit tests for instructions we implement in the ISS.

## What You Must Do To Complete The Assignment?

There are two parts you must complete in the assignment:

1. The program part (i.e., the ISS) --- **80%** of scores
2. Assignment Report --- **20%** of scores

In the program part, the score is further divided into two parts:

1. ISS compilation test<br>
   - You can get **10%** of scores if your ISS can be compiled without any error 
2. Instruction unit tests with `riscv-tests`
   - You can get **70%** of scores if you can pass all the 37 unit tests for the instructions we implement
